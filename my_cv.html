        <h1>Martin Gausseran</h1>
        <h2>BeCode Student | Junior Developer, Graphic &amp; Web Designer</h2>
        <p>Passionate about information and communication techniques, I'm constantly looking for new ideas to share content and tell stories in the most original and coherent way possible. My past professional experiences and my mastery of various software suites and programming languages give me a wide range of skills in multimedia production, so that form always serves content.</p>

            <h2>May 2021 - October 2023</h2>
            <h3>The British School of Brussels</h3>
            <h4>Communications Admin Coordinator</h4>
            <p>Following the constraints of the pandemic, I had to adapt and start a new career in communications. It was an opportunity for me to discover a new field, and to work in an international and English-speaking team. Not only was I able to put my journalistic skills and taste for images to good use, but I was also able to master new digital tools to help the school promote its programme beyond its walls. I've also learnt how to manage crises, short deadlines and the stress that comes with them, how to organise my work as part of a team, and how to use social networks in a professional way to rally an audience.</p>

            <h2>November 2019 - October 2021</h2>
            <h3>L’Humanité - Encrage Médias</h3>
            <h4>Independent journalist</h4>
            <p>Reporting from abroad. During a solo trip to the United States, I chose to report on Gulf War veterans, the gay community under the Trump presidency, white supremacists and the economic decline of Detroit. On the field, I learned to adapt, to react quickly to problems and to methodically organise my objectives in a context where I had no other resource than myself. I then continued to work for L'Humanité in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and at the same time produced a major dossier on drug addiction in Brussels.</p>

            <h2>July 2018 - September 2019</h2>
            <h3>L’Humanité - Huffington Post Maroc</h3>
            <h4>Journalist</h4>
            <p>Short assignments to produce video and written reports and interviews in the political, medical and cultural fields. These different assignments helped to shape my relationship with information, consolidate my interest in societal issues, and helped me to improve my writing skills as well as my ability to popularise a concept, explain a complex idea and tell a story. The challenge was all the more important for me because it gave me the opportunity to work abroad, which is something I deeply enjoyed.</p>
